# Hey Everyone! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeamusMullan/SeamusMullan/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

Hello! My name is Seamus Mullan and I am a Secondary School Student in Lucan Community College and I am currently in 5th Year.

I am currently working on a bunch of my projects and I am also learning a lot about programming and how to use Git and GitHub.
Some of the things I am working on are:

- A Horror Game made in Unreal Engine 4
- A Portal-Like game made in Unity
- An Audio Effect plugin called **Eliminator** which will be coming out soon (Hopefully)
- An OSINT Tool called CherryBomb made in Python using a bunch of APIs and request functions!
- A Discord Bot that creates graphs based on StockX data.
- And a bunch of other things that I would like to finish!

My hobbies are playing and making Video Games, Programming and Music Production as you can probably tell by now, but i also like to take apart and rebuild old electronics that I own to try and learn more about how they work.
