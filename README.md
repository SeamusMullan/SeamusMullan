# Hey There! <img src="https://github.com/SeamusMullan/SeamusMullan/blob/main/wave.gif?raw=true" width="30px">

Hello! My name is Seamus Mullan and I'm a College Student in Maynooth University (Bachelor of Science, Majority Computer Science)
I am currently working on a bunch of my projects and I am also learning a lot about programming, DSP and web development.
**Some of the things I am working on are:**

- My Own Audio Software Business (DirektDSP)
  - A bunch of VST Effect Plugins (Hot Potato / Fuzzboy) -- https://direktdsp.com
  - Source code is available through the website!
- Some ports for Minecraft Mods (Still working on some of these)

My hobbies range from general programming and video games to artistic things like music production and sketching. I'm pretty versatile when it comes to skills and like to gain new insights into almost any science related fields.
