# Hey Everyone! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeamusMullan/SeamusMullan/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

Hello! My name is Seamus Mullan and I am a Secondary School Student in Lucan Community College and I am currently in 5th Year.

I am currently working on a bunch of my projects and I am also learning a lot about programming and how to use Git and GitHub.
Some of the things I am working on are:

- A Horror Game made in Unity inspired by the [SCP Foundation](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com) and [SCP:Containment Breach](https://scpcbgame.com)
- An OSINT Tool called CherryBomb made in Python that can be used for ethical hacking!
- Security tools for use in schools to teach student and teachers about the dangers of the internet.
- And a bunch of other things that I would like to finish for fun like Discord and Instagram bots!

My hobbies are playing and making Video Games, Programming and Music Production, but I also like to take apart and rebuild old electronics that I own to try and learn more about how they work and the design process behind them. My favourite Video Game has to be Portal since it's one of the first video games I've ever played!
