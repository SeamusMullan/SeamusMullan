# Hey There! <img src="https://github.com/SeamusMullan/SeamusMullan/blob/main/wave.gif?raw=true" width="30px">

Hello! My name is Seamus Mullan and I'm a College Student in Maynooth University (Bachelor of Science)
I am currently working on a bunch of my own projects and am also improving my knowledge of Signal Processing and C++.
**My most significant project currently is DirektDSP (Audio Software Company)**
  - Source code is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/direktdsp)

**The areas that I work in most include:**
  - VST3 / AU Audio Plugins
  - Small video game projects in Unity
  - Small simulation projects in Processing

My hobbies range from general programming and video games to artistic things like music production and sketching. I'm pretty versatile when it comes to skills and like to gain new insights into almost any science related fields.
